By combining a U-Net architecture for defect segmentation with a CNN for classification, the approach improves the identification and categorization of steel surface anomalies, enhancing quality control and production efficiency. The study also addresses key challenges in the field, offering insights into model performance and data distribution issues.","20-10-2024","https://steel-defect-detection.streamlit.app/","https://github.com/5rijan/Steel-Defect-Detection-A-Combined-U-Net-and-CNN-Approach","Website,JupyterNotebook,Python,Pandas,Numpy,Tensorflow,Matplotlib,Streamlit"
"/assets/project/Paper-1.jpg, /assets/project/Paper-2.jpg","PaperBridge","Scientific knowledge is predominantly stored in books and scientific journals, often in the form of PDFs. However, the PDF format leads to a significant loss of semantic information, particularly for mathematical expressions and scientific figures. Paperbridge addresses these challenges by converting PDFs into Mathpix Markdown (MMD), a markup language that preserves the document's structural and semantic integrity.","10-08-2024","https://5rijan.github.io/paperbridge-docs/","https://github.com/5rijan/PaperBridge/tree/main","Extension,Python,Nougat,PDFFigures,Transformers,Js"
