At its core, itâ€™s a streamlined interface that compiles information from various university sites into one convenient platform. The app serves as an interactive platform for exploring all the units offered by the university in the form of graph nodes. You can visualize how these units are connected, easily access detailed information about each unit, and discover new pathways for your degree. It also features a powerful timetable generator, allowing you to quickly create a personalized schedule. Simply select your units, apply filters like preferred days and times, and let USydGraph build your timetable, complete with activity details and locations.","27-12-2024","https://usydgraph.onrender.com/","https://github.com/5rijan/timetable-dilly-dally","Website,Python,Html,Css,Flask,Js,GraphVisuals"

I proposed a two-stage deep learning framework that synergistically combines a U-Net architecture for precise defect segmentation with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate defect classification. My method tackles the complexities of identifying and categorizing various types of steel surface anomalies, contributing to enhanced quality control and production efficiency in steel manufacturing processes. The study also addresses current limitations and challenges in the field, providing insights into model performance and data distribution issues.","20-10-2024","https://steel-defect-detection.streamlit.app/","https://github.com/5rijan/Steel-Defect-Detection-A-Combined-U-Net-and-CNN-Approach","Website,JupyterNotebook,Python,Pandas,Numpy,Tensorflow,Matplotlib,Streamlit"
"/assets/project/Paper-1.jpg, /assets/project/Paper-2.jpg","PaperBridge","Scientific knowledge is predominantly stored in books and scientific journals, often in the form of PDFs. However, the PDF format leads to a significant loss of semantic information, particularly for mathematical expressions and scientific figures. Paperbridge addresses these challenges by converting PDFs into Mathpix Markdown (MMD), a markup language that preserves the document's structural and semantic integrity.","10-08-2024","https://5rijan.github.io/paperbridge-docs/","https://github.com/5rijan/PaperBridge/tree/main","Extension,Python,Nougat,PDFFigures,Transformers,Js"
