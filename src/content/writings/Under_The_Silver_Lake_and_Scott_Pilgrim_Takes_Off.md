# Under The Silver Lake and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off  

Holidays are over, and we are officially in 2025. Every year, I’ve noticed that the first movies I watch seem to set the tone for the rest of the year. Maybe I’m superstitious, or maybe not, but this has become a sort of ritual for me—choosing movies to kickstart my year.

Last year, it was _The Package_ and _Rushmore_. It’s not about the story itself but the vibe these movies create for the year. And 2024? It was an absolute blast. I kickstarted my career, grew a lot as a person, and achieved what I’d call a “semi-success,” if I had to put a label on it.

This year, I started with two picks: the movie _Under the Silver Lake_ by David Robert Mitchell and the animated series _Scott Pilgrim Takes Off_, a spinoff of one of my all-time favorite films, _Scott Pilgrim vs. the World_.

### Under the Silver Lake

If I had to describe _Under the Silver Lake_ in one sentence, it’d be: “What the actual fuck?” I’m not exaggerating—I’m still baffled and conflicted about what I watched and what I’m supposed to take away from it. It wasn’t a pleasant, life-changing “mind-blown” experience, but more of an infuriating one. Two days later, the movie still lingers in the back of my mind, frustrating me for reasons I can’t quite pin down.

The movie is a neo-noir, paying tribute to 1940s and 1950s Hollywood. As a novice in the genre, I’ll admit I probably didn’t catch all the hidden messages—the subtlety is part of its theme, and perhaps part of what baffles me.

The story follows Andrew Garfield’s character, a lonely man whose background isn’t fully fleshed out but can be pieced together through the details. He’s an artsy guy (as seen through his love of music, movie memorabilia, and his social circle) but deeply flawed—annoying, intrusive, and overall unlikeable. He spies on people, has a one-sided love interest, annoys his loving mother, and may even be a dog-killer, driven by unexplained hate.

The plot kicks off when he meets a girl, spies on her, and later confronts her. They spend a nice evening together, but the next day, she vanishes without explanation. His quest to find her leads him into a maze of secret messages hidden in music, advertisements, movies, games, and everyday art.

Without spoiling too much, the story unfolds across the stunning backdrop of Los Angeles, blending his external search for the girl with an internal journey of self-reflection. By the end, while the character doesn’t necessarily grow in the traditional sense, he comes to terms with harsh truths about the world and his place in it.

One key theme is the division between “coyotes” and “dogs.” Coyotes are the wealthy elite who control narratives and live in luxury, while dogs are the rest of us—deluded into thinking we have power. Yet, the story also offers a deeper take: dogs, though seemingly powerless, form packs, build communities, and represent loyalty and diversity. Similarly, the life of a coyote is questioned—are they truly happy?

The movie was a solid 7/10 for me, thanks to its beautiful score by Disasterpeace, clever writing, and subtle touches like Morse code and double-meaning dialogues. I understand why it’s polarizing, with long, dialogue-free scenes that rely on visual storytelling.

### Scott Pilgrim Takes Off

On the other hand, _Scott Pilgrim Takes Off_ is a much lighter watch. This 8-episode animated series, created by Science SARU (an amazing studio—check out _Ride Your Wave_), feels like one long movie. The fast pace, beautiful animation, and music set a fun tone.

The story itself is straightforward and doesn’t demand much brainpower—perfect for relaxing with a pizza and just enjoying the ride. One standout moment is in Episode 3, "Ramona Rents a Video," where Knives, Kim, and Stephen bond, and Knives plays the bass for the first time. The sequence, accompanied by Anamanaguchi’s music, is easily one of my favorites.

Overall, I’d rate it a 6.5/10—a nostalgic revisit to my childhood crush, Ramona Flowers, and a great way to kick back and unwind.

Looking back, 2024 was a productive year for the logical, professional side of me—the software engineer and researcher, Srijan. But it wasn’t great for the creative side of me: the Srijan who loves reading, writing, cinema, and painting.

These two picks give me hope that 2025 will let me reconnect with that artistic Srijan.
