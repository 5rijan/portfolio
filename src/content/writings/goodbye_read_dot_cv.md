**Goodnight, Read.cv**  

I’m writing this on January 17th — from today, Read.cv will begin winding down its business. This moment feels bittersweet for me.  

There's no hiding it: I'm an avid hater of LinkedIn. It's always felt like a fake place, where everyone seems unreal. For some reason, the vibe of that platform has repelled me every time I've tried using it. So much so that I haven't bothered updating my profile for the past two years — and honestly, I doubt I ever will, unless I’m forced to when I step into the industry someday.  

For me, and people like me, Read.cv has been an oasis. It’s lightweight, it feels like home, and everyone on there is so genuine. I felt like this platform connected me to *my* world. But now, it's closing down.  

Perplexity is acquiring the platform — and for some fucking reason, they've decided to shut it down. I hate when companies do this. They acquire platforms for the people and the data, not because they care about the platform itself. I can't stand it.  

But at the same time, I have to admit that the Read.cv team of three did an amazing job. They deserve their success and a well-earned break. I can't blame them for making this decision. Still, it leaves me wondering how cruel this industry can be.  

I guess it’s time for me to say goodbye — and goodnight — to this platform.
